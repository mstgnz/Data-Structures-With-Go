* Trolling, insulting/defamatory comments and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing the private information of others, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for explaining acceptable standards of behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action against unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban contributors who exhibit inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in project spaces and public areas when a person represents the project or community. Examples of representing the project or community include using the official project email address, posting on the official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will be responded to as appropriate to the situation. The project team is obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the person reporting the incident.
