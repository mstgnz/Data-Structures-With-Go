# Data Structures Examples

This folder contains examples of using basic data structures.

## Content

1. **Stack
   - Array-based stack implementation
   - LinkedList based stack implementation
   - LIFO (Last In First Out) principle

2. **Queue (Queue)**
   - Array-based queue implementation
   - LinkedList based queue implementation
   - FIFO (First In First Out) principle

3. **LinkedList
   - Single linked list
   - Adding, deleting and searching elements
   - Add elements at the beginning and end of a list

4. **Tree
   - Binary Search Tree implementation
   - Tree traversal methods (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
   - Adding, deleting and searching elements

5. **Heap**
   - Min Heap implementation
   - Max Heap implementation
   - Priority queuing applications

6. **Hash Table**
   - Hash function implementation
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Working with key-value pairs

## Usage

Each data structure has its own folder with examples. To run the examples:

```bash
# Run example
go run examples/stack/stack_examples.go
go run examples/queue/queue_examples.go
go run examples/linkedlist/linkedlist_examples.go
go run examples/tree/binary_tree_examples.go
go run examples/heap/heap_examples.go
go run examples/hash/hash_examples.go
```

## Notes

- Each example file illustrates the basic operations of the corresponding data structure
- Examples include practical uses of data structures
- Each example includes explanatory comments
